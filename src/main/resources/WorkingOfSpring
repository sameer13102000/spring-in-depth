Session 2
Dyanmic case
When there are multiple beans, Spring usually throws error as it does not understand which bean to consider for auto-wiring.
So in such cases we need to give an priorty case mentioning as @Primary for the bean which you want to execute(Autowired).

Session4
Dynamic Case: In case of @Primary and Autowiring by Name. @Primary has the highest Priorty.
The Spring will consider the @Priorty as the 1st preference and will execute it.
